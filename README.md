# Nikita Ekerns DotFiles

These are config files to set up Mac OS X command line.

## What's Inside

- [ZSH](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) configuration files.

## Installation

For now just use git clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ekernik/dotfiles.git
```

And then manually link files to corresponding config folders on your machine.

Later I will add installation script.

## Uninstallation

Same goes here, script will be added later, for now manually remove/unlink config files.
